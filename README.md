## 1. Introduction

The aim of this project is to promote safe behavior online and encourage individuals to use the internet consciously and securely.

In this project:

- **HTML** was used to create the skeleton and layout structure.
- **CSS** was used to add design and visual styling.
- **JavaScript** added dynamic features such as getting the current date, theme switching, hamburger menu for mobile devices, and loading components in a modular way.

---

## 2. Problem Statement and Proposed Solution

The main security issue addressed in this project is **password safety**. Many users still rely on weak passwords, exposing themselves to cyber threats.

Our website presents informative content to raise awareness and provide guidance. It represents a corporate-style digital security company that educates users about safe password creation, showcases the company’s identity and success, and features a simulated security quiz along with sections on device safety, phishing protection, and password exercises.

---

## 3. Project Objectives

- Create a user-friendly and informative digital security awareness website
- Provide security tips and an interactive quiz for users
- Ensure a fully responsive design for all devices
- Build a professional and trustworthy visual theme

---

## 4. Target Audience

This site is intended for everyone—young or old, male or female. It aims to make the general public more conscious and secure internet users.

---

## 5. Website Content Strategy

The website includes:

- Informative articles
- Security tips
- Password exercises
- Phishing protection guides
- An interactive quiz called "Test Yourself"
- Corporate pages: About, Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Contact

Content is structured to engage users and is built with future updates and management in mind.

---

## 6. Template and Design

- Logo and color palette were designed using Adobe Photoshop.
- Footer and navbar were hand-drawn during the planning phase.
- Templates and overall layout follow a corporate and professional theme.

---

## 7. Tools and Technologies

- **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Testing Environment:** Live Server
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Graphic Tools:** Adobe Photoshop, Canva
- **Languages Used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

---

## 8. Implementation Plan

- The site was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Responsive design achieved with `@media` queries.
- Cross-browser compatibility was tested (Chrome, Brave, Opera, Safari).
- Interactive features include a mobile-friendly hamburger menu and theme toggle.
- Modular component structure implemented.

---

## 9. Innovation and Community Impact

This website aims to make online safety a daily habit. As a result, users can behave more cautiously across platforms, reducing the risk of scams and fraud.

---

## 10. Website Accessibility and SEO Considerations

Accessibility and discoverability were improved using:

- WCAG-compliant HTML tags
- Semantic structure
- Meta tags such as `keywords`, `description`, `author`, and `robots`
- Alt attributes for images

---

## 11. Testing and Validation

Every element of the site was tested locally via Live Server during development. Layout, responsiveness, and interactions were continuously monitored.

---

## 12. Conclusions and Future Recommendations

Most improvement occurred in CSS skills during this project. If further developed:

- A backend using TypeScript or Java could be added
- An admin panel for content management could be implemented
- A user registration/login system with database integration could be introduced
